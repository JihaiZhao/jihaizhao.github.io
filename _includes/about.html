        <p>I graduated from Ohio State University in 2023 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. 
          Through various projects related to robotics during my undergrad, I gained knowledge and experience in path planning and controlling for a differential drive mobile robot. 
          I also designed a robotic arm and applied deep learning algorithms.
          I am a Masters in Robotics student at Northwestern University. My main interests are in SLAM, machine learning, and computer vision.</p>
