description: <br><p>The goal of this project is to simulate a jack bouncing inside of a moving box. The drawing below shows the configuration and transformation of frames I used. For simulation, I simulate the jack starting at the center of the box with zero initial velocity and zero theta for 10 seconds with a time step of 0.01s.</p><br><img class="img-responsive" src="img/me314/drawing.jpg" alt="profile-pic" /><p>Frame W is the world frame, frame A is the frame of the center of box, frame B is the frame of the center of the jack. g_B1, g_B2, g_B3, g_B4 are the transformations from frame B to the four edges of the jack. </p></br></br>
