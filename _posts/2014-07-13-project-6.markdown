description: <h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4><br><p>The propose of this project is writing software that plans a trajectory for the end-effector of the youBot mobile manipulator (a mobile base with four mecanum wheels and a 5R robot arm), performs odometry as the chassis moves, and performs feedback control to drive the youBot to pick up a block at a specified location, carry it to a desired location, and put it down.</p><br><p>To achieve the goal of the project I wrote 4 functions.</p><ul><li>NextState</li><ul><p>Input<span>:</span> The input of the function includes config, speed, timestep, max_speed</p><br><p>config<span>:</span> A 12-vector representing the current configuration of the robot (3 variables for the chassis configuration, 5 variables for the arm configuration, and 4 variables for the wheel angles).</p><br><p>speed<span>:</span> A 9-vector of controls indicating the wheel speeds and the arm joint speeds</p><br><p>timestep<span>:</span> A timestep</p><br><p>max_speed<span>:</span> A positive real value indicating the maximum angular speed of the arm joints and the wheels.</p><br>  <p>For example, if this value is 12.3, the angular speed of the wheels and arm joints is limited to the range [-12.3 radians/s, 12.3 radians/s]. Any speed in the 9-vector of controls that is outside this range will be set to the nearest boundary of the range.</p><br><p>Output<span>:</span> The return of the function is new_config</p><br><p>new_config<span>:</span> A 12-vector representing the configuration of robot. </p><br><p>The function NextState is based on a simple first-order Euler step, i.e., new arm joint angles = (old arm joint angles) + (joint speeds) * new wheel angles = (old wheel angles) + (wheel speeds) * new chassis configuration is obtained from odometry. </p></ul>
