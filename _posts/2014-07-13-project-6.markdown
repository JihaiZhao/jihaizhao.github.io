description: <br><h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4><p>The propose of this project is writing software that plans a trajectory for the end-effector of the youBot mobile manipulator (a mobile base with four mecanum wheels and a 5R robot arm), performs odometry as the chassis moves, and performs feedback control to drive the youBot to pick up a block at a specified location, carry it to a desired location, and put it down.</p><br><p>To achieve the goal of the project I wrote 4 functions.</p></br></br>
