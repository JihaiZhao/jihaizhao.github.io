description: The propose of this project is writing software that plans a trajectory for the end-effector of the youBot mobile manipulator (a mobile base with four mecanum wheels and a 5R robot arm), performs odometry as the chassis moves, and performs feedback control to drive the youBot to pick up a block at a specified location, carry it to a desired location, and put it down. <a href="https://github.com/JihaiZhao/KUKA-youBot-Mobile-Manipulation" >Github</a>

#         <p>As part of an independent study class, I implemented a collection of essential motion planning algorithms and necessary utility functions.<p>
#         <br>
#             <br>
#                 <p>As the foundation of planning, I implemented a graph-based Probablistic Road Map (PRM). Also, I implemented a grid map to discretize the search space
