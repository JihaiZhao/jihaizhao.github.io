<br>
    <p>The propose of this project is writing software that plans a trajectory for the end-effector of the youBot mobile manipulator (a mobile base with four mecanum wheels and a 5R robot arm), performs odometry as the chassis moves, and performs feedback control to drive the youBot to pick up a block at a specified location, carry it to a desired location, and put it down.</p>

    <p>Frame W is the world frame, frame A is the frame of the center of box, frame B is the frame of the center of the jack. g_B1, g_B2, g_B3, g_B4 are the transformations from frame B to the four edges of the jack.

#         <p>As part of an independent study class, I implemented a collection of essential motion planning algorithms and necessary utility functions.<p>

#             <br>
#                 <p>As the foundation of planning, I implemented a graph-based Probablistic Road Map (PRM). Also, I implemented a grid map to discretize the search space
