description: <h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4><p style="text-align:left;">The purpose of the project is to track the location of fingertip in realtime and draw the path of fingertip movement in 3D.</p><h4><strong>Video Demo</strong></h4><iframe width="700" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/INRJ8Y_SD4U?si=X1NxuWG7hQWI9v2w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><h4><strong>Image Segmentation</strong></h4><p style="text-align:left;">The first step is background subtraction and skin Color extraction. I decided to use YCrCb color ranges since many studies show that YCrCb color ranges are best for representing the skin color region. I first split it into 3 channels (Y, Cr, Cb) and threshold each channel independently. For each channel, I use morphology operators to remove noise and latter combine them using cv2.bitwise_and(mask_Y, cv2.bitwise_and(mask_Cr, mask_Cb)). Last, threshold binarization to smooth the image</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Result image after Image Segmentation ​:</p><img class="center" src="img/finger_cursor/image_segmentation.png" alt="profile-pic" /><br><h4><strong>Detection​</strong></h4><p style="text-align:left;">Computing a convex hull for an object and compute its convexity is a good way to find the shape of human hand as hand shapes are very well characterized by such defects. The convexity defects getting from openCV include information of start points, end points, depth points, and distance between the farthest contour point and the hull</p><br><p style="text-align:left;">The issue is these information include noise. To determine precise fingers locations, it must meet several criteria below:</p><ul>i.Depth of each defects must be longer than palm center radius</ul><ul>ii. Angle between start point and end point must be less than 90°</ul>implement law of cosines
