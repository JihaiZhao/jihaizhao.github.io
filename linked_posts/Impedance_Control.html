        In modern robotics, achieving seamless human-robot interaction is a critical goal for enabling intuitive and
        effective operation. This project focuses on implementing impedance control for a robotic arm to enhance its
        compliance and ease of use during manual guidance. By designing an appropriate virtual impedance model, the
        system can regulate the dynamic interaction between the user and the robotic arm, allowing smooth and effortless
        dragging motions.

        The robotic arm used in this project is the Franka Emika Panda, known for its precision and advanced control
        capabilities. The primary objective is to develop and fine-tune an impedance control framework that minimizes
        the userâ€™s effort while maintaining stability and responsiveness. The implementation involves careful adjustment
        of the virtual mass, damping, and stiffness parameters to achieve a balance between compliance and accuracy.

        By leveraging impedance control, this project aims to improve the human-robot interface, making it suitable for
        applications requiring physical interaction, such as collaborative tasks, medical assistance, and precision
        manufacturing. This work demonstrates the potential of impedance-based strategies in advancing robotic systems
        towards more intuitive and user-friendly designs.
