    <p>
        In modern robotics, achieving seamless human-robot interaction is essential for intuitive and effective
        operation.
        This project focuses on implementing impedance control for the Franka Emika Panda robotic arm to enhance
        compliance
        and ease of use during manual guidance. By designing an optimized virtual impedance model, the system regulates
        the
        dynamic interaction between the user and the robotic arm, enabling smooth and effortless dragging motions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary objective is to fine-tune the impedance control framework to minimize user effort while maintaining
        stability and responsiveness. This involves carefully adjusting virtual mass, damping, and stiffness parameters
        to
        strike a balance between compliance and precision. Leveraging the Panda armâ€™s advanced control capabilities
        ensures
        high performance and adaptability.
    </p>
    <p>
        This work establishes a solid foundation for future projects exploring advanced human-robot interaction
        techniques. By refining impedance control strategies, subsequent research can address more complex applications,
        such as adaptive assistance in dynamic environments, autonomous collaboration, and advanced manipulation tasks.
        These advancements will further enhance the intuitiveness and functionality of robotic systems.

    <hr class="para-break" data-content="  Impedance Control  " id="intro">
    <p>
        Impedance control is a hybrid motion-force control strategy that governs the interaction between a robot and its
        environment. It is widely used to regulate the dynamic relationship between force and motion, ensuring a
        compliant and smooth interaction. The control law for impedance control is based on defining a desired
        mass-spring-damper system, as expressed by the task-space behavior:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <strong>Equation:</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?M\ddot{x}+B\dot{x}+Kx=f_{\text{ext}}"
            alt="M x'' + B x' + Kx = f_ext">
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>x</strong>: Task-space configuration of the robot.</li>
        <li><strong>M</strong>: Virtual mass matrix.</li>
        <li><strong>B</strong>: Virtual damping matrix.</li>
        <li><strong>K</strong>: Virtual stiffness matrix.</li>
        <li><strong>f<sub>ext</sub></strong>: External force applied to the robot.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The parameters <strong>M</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>K</strong> are tuned to achieve the desired
        dynamic behavior of the robotic system. For instance:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>High stiffness (<strong>K</strong>) reduces motion for a given applied force, making the robot behave
            rigidly.</li>
        <li>High damping (<strong>B</strong>) ensures smooth motion without oscillations.</li>
        <li>Low virtual mass (<strong>M</strong>) increases responsiveness to external forces.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
    <p>
        The impedance control strategy can also be analyzed using its frequency response characteristics. The impedance
        is defined as the transfer function between position perturbations and forces:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Z(s)=\frac{F(s)}{X(s)}=ms^2+bs+K"
            alt="Z(s) = F(s)/X(s) = ms^2 + bs + K">
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, <strong>Z(s)</strong> represents the system's impedance in the Laplace domain. The inverse of impedance,
        known as <strong>admittance</strong>, is given by:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Y(s)=\frac{1}{Z(s)}=\frac{1}{ms^2+bs+K}" alt="Y(s) = 1 / Z(s)">
    </p>
    <p>
        A high impedance system (e.g., with large <strong>K</strong> and <strong>B</strong>) resists motion disturbances
        but responds minimally to external forces, whereas a low impedance system (e.g., with small <strong>M</strong>,
        <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>K</strong>) is more compliant and allows greater motion for a given force. For
        applications requiring user interaction, such as dragging a robotic arm, a compliant behavior is often desired
        to make the interaction smooth and effortless.
    </p>
    <h4>Implementation</h4>
    <p>
        Impedance control can be implemented using feedback laws that map task-space positions or torques to forces. The
        parameters <strong>M</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>K</strong> are chosen to achieve the desired
        behavior, ensuring stability and adaptability during interaction.

        Me and
        <a href="
        https://courtsmith77.github.io/" , target="_blank">Courtney</a>
        implemented it based on <a href="
            https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/libfranka.html" , target="_blank">libfranka library</a>which is a C++
        library provided by Franka. We implemented three
        different modes and compare the perforce with the default one.
        We called them as damping mode, friction_compensation mode, and
        the default mode (white-light mode). Damping mode is adding an extra negative damper to help user feel
        weightless when moving the robot. Friction_compensation, is add constant joint impedance to compensate the
        influence of friction in each joints.

        A force/torque sensor <a href="
        https://www.ati-ia.com/products/ft/ft_models.aspx?id=Axia80-M8" , target="_blank">Axia80-M8</a> has been used
        to provide accurate reading about how much force and torque the user applied when using the impedance control
        mode to move the robot. Also 3D printed a customed handle which allows user drag the robot easier.

    <p>
        For data collection, we first need to modify the ip-address of the ft sensor, Franka, and station of Franka, to
        make sure they are able to communicate with each other. Then we used a <a href="
        https://github.com/gbartyzel/ros2_net_ft_driver" , target="_blank">Net F/T Sensor Driver</a> to launch the
        controller and ros2 bag to record data. For robot data, it been saved as csv file when we drag it using
        impedance control. We also wrote a python pipeline for data processing and analyzing.
    </p>
    <p>
        To find the best mode, We purpose a dynamic equation to describe the force that the user used: \( f(t) = m*a(t)
        - c * v(t) \)
        Then we collect data using each impedance control mode and move in x, y, z direction seperately and finally
        calculate m and c. We assume, the best mode should have a relative small m and c. and performance keep stable in
        all direction. We also plot the 3D-plot to show the relationship between acceleration, velocity and force. The
        conclusion is, damping mode is the best.
