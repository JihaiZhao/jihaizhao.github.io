    <hr class="para-break" data-content="  Overview  " id="intro">
    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to leverage <strong>ergodic imitation</strong> to learn both desirable and
        undesirable behaviors.
        To facilitate effective data collection, I first implemented an <strong>impedance control mode</strong> for a
        7-DoF collaborative robotic arm
        (Franka) in collaboration with Courtney. Subsequently, I developed a <strong>haptic-guided
            teleoperation</strong> system for the Franka robot.
        This system enables the user to control <strong>Franka 1</strong>, which operates in impedance control mode, and
        couples its movements to
        <strong>Franka 2</strong>, such that any motion of Franka 1 is mirrored by Franka 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following this, I employed a <strong>learning-from-demonstration (LfD)</strong> approach to derive robust task
        definitions from a combination
        of positive and negative demonstrations. The algorithmic framework for task learning is based on the
        <strong>ergodic metric</strong>, a measure
        of the information content in motion. Finally, I demonstrated the efficacy of this learning approach on
        (.......) using the 7-DoF Franka arm.

        写个intro
        For the hardware,
    </p>
    <p>
        As the baseline setup, I first implemented the “No Feedback” condition which is direct joint-position coupling
        to control the slave robot motion via the master robot.
        To control the Franka Robot, I used <a href="https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/libfranka.html" ,
            target="_blank">libfranka library</a> which is a C++ library provided by Franka.
        For master robot I used the impedance control mode I implemented before (more detail can be find in this
        post,给连接). For the slave robot I used a control loop in the libfranka model library.
        This control loop include two Callback functions for sending joint-level torque commands and target joint
        positions.
        The torque command was computed from joint impedance control law and the target joint positions were received
        from the master Franka robot. For the communication between the master and slave robot, I used ROS2 subscription
        and publisher to share the JointState information.

    <p>
        To ensure a better perforce of teleoperation, I added Force Feedback. The calculated torque from the slave robot
        will keep publishing and received by the master robot. Then the torque on the master robot is the combination of
        impedance control and the torque reading.

        Collecting data using haptic-guided teleoperation. Remember the location of the points,
        (give positive/negative labels) using k-means to do clustering. Find the center of each cluster and generate
        probability density function

        <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">
            $$ f_k(x) = \frac{1}{h_k} \prod_{i=1}^{d} \cos\left( \frac{k_i \pi}{L_i} x_i \right), $$
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        where <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">$h_k$</span> is the normalization term, such that the
        function space norm of each basis function
        <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">$\left[\int_{\mathcal{X}} f_k(x)^2
            dx\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}$</span> is 1.
    </p>

    <p>
        The normalized basis functions consist of a set of <em>orthonormal bases</em> in the infinite dimensional
        function space. Thus, we can transform any function with the same domain (the search space) into a set of new
        coordinates under these <em>orthonormal bases</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given a spatial probability density function <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">$p(x)$</span>,
        we can transform this function as follows:
    </p>

    <p>
        <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">
            $$\
            p(x) = \sum_{k}^{\infty} \left( \underbrace{\int_{\mathcal{X}} p(x) f_k(x) dx}_{\phi_k} \right) \cdot f_k(x)
            \\
            = \sum_{k}^{\infty} \phi_k \cdot f_k(x)
            $$
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        where all the coefficients <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">$[\phi_k]$</span> consist of the
        coordinates of the function <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">$p(x)$</span> under the bases
        <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">$[f_k(x)]$</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Though the equality only holds in theory when we have an infinite number of basis functions, in practice, we can
        choose a finite number of basis functions to approximate an infinite dimensional function <span
            style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">$p(x)$</span> within a finite dimensional Euclidean space (a
        finite number of coefficients).
    </p>

    <p>
        This transformation from an infinite dimensional function space to a finite dimensional vector space is crucial
        for the ergodic metric. We now verify this transformation below.

        it can be considered as an optimal control problem. The iterative linear quadratic regular (iLQR) algorithm
        follows a gradient descent approach to find a locally optimal solution.
        Given the current estimation of the control u(t) , at each iteration, iLQR finds the descent direction v(t) by
        solving the following ODEs:

        For the ergodic controller,
        we model the system as a double-integrator with state X =
        [x, y, ẋ, ẏ] and U = [ẍ, ÿ].
